Making a tournament website to learn and practice html, css, and javascript

I don't know much but in here there is all the stuff to create brackets and be able to advance players to the next round until getting a winner.
Also a good amount of customizablity when creating a tournament for you or friends. Everything is client side bc I know nothing and don't care to
know anything about network code.
